> Fetishising adult life
> Care more about the *idea* of something, rather than the thing itself

> Laten infatilisation? life truly starting too late
> lack of other goals -> turning work into personality

There is an increasing fetishisation of academic and corporate life amongst
young people today. They fawn over clock app videos of office workers toiling
away doing absolutely nothing. Longing to be a "dark academic", reading dusty
books, the topic of which is irrelevant, as long as it's leather bound and 
hasn't been touched for at least 50 years.
