I always thought lactose intolerance was something made up by the American media,
some strange milk related disease given to the nerdy kid to add to his 
humiliation, for I had never in my entire life met someone who was lactose 
intolerant. In recent years however, rates of lactose intolerance, and other 
allergies to completely normal foods like eggs, have risen dramatically here in 
Britain. Unlike in America, where people often have a rather mixed heritage, 
often with Africans or natives, here in Britain these allergies are coming from
white children with no family history of such things. Where are these allergies
coming from? At first I thought this may be due to increased use of formula, 
but it's hard to make any conclusions on the data that I've found: Initial
breastfeeding in 6-8 weeks has gone up by a conciderable amount in the past two
decades, this seems to drop off exponentially though, with rates of children
being breastfed up to 6 months is remarkably low at just 1%,
whilst in countries such as Norway it's over 70%. Breastfeeding, although 
certainly a positive, is probably not the cause of this, as multiple studies in 
Sweden have found increasing allergies amongst children, specifically to milk and
eggs. Similar things have been found in Australia (with similarly high rates of 
breastfeeding to Norway and Sweden) where children are five times 
as likely to have allergies as adults. 

The hygiene hypothesis is a rather popular one, that we are simply too cleanly 
these days, and that we wrap our children up in bubble wrap so much, that the 
second they set food outside they start sneezing. This hypothesis has some 30 
years of research behind it, with lots of mixed results. One that I found 
interesting however was that children with pets were significantly more likely
to not have allergies. (There are many saying this is due to covid, however this
trend has been going on for over a decade now).   

Maybe there is some horrible chemical in both formula and normal food which passes
into the breastmilk which is causing all this. Maybe the rapeseed oil haters are
correct. Maybe the microplastics which are undoubtedly in the cows and chickens
are causing all this.

Another interesting thing to note is that children are likely to grow out of milk
and egg allergies much more than something like a peanut or shellfish allergy, 
which may mean this will become something common like eczma,
which children tend to grow out of.

lovely Kentish lady, however I didn't feel they really fit together so I separated
them. I didn't cite any sources because I'm lazy :3*
